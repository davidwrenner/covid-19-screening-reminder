# COVID-19 Screening Reminder App


### About
It's easy to forget to complete WashU's daily COVID-19 screening
before coming to campus.
This project aims to help students and faculty maintain a safe
campus by sending a screening reminder via text message each day.

### Usage
To use this service, provide your phone number, preferred reminder
time, and applicable days of the week on [the site](http://ec2-18-117-146-61.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/~davidwrenner/reminder/index.html). This data is hosted on
a private server and will remain anonymous.

### Future Updates
